### Brief Decription of Baseline System

We used a brute force method to implement the baseline system.   

Firstly, we recorded all occurences of named entities during traing phase.   

Secondly, during testing phase, all occurences all named entities and their indexes are recognized and recorded in a dictionary.

Finally, the recorded results are write to `solution.txt`  

Detailed description of our baseline system are recorded in file `baseline.py`
