##Sequence Tagging Model###Implementation Details(a) “ImplementationDetails”Makeclearwhichsequencetaggingmethod(s) that you selected. Make clear which parts were implemented from scratch vs. obtained via an existing package. Explain and motivate any design choices providing the intuition behind them.

### Pre-Proecessing(b) “Pre-Processing” Explain and motivate the pre-processing steps you apply to the data.

### Experiments(c) “Experiments” Describe the motivations and methodology of the ex- periments that you ran. Clearly state what were your hypotheses and what were your expectations.### Results(d) “Results” Summarize the performance of your system and any varia- tions that you experimented with on both the training/validation and test dataset. Note that you have to compare your own sys- tem to at least one other non-trivial baseline system. Put the results into clearly labeled tables or diagrams and include your observations and analysis. An error analysis is required – e.g. what sorts of errors occurred, why? When did the system work well, when did it fail and any ideas as to why? How might you improve the system?

### Competition Score(e) “Competition Score” Include your team name and the screenshot of your best score from Kaggle.
##Extensions  Explain the extensions that you decided to do. Include the implementation details, the experiments, and the results similar to the previous section. If your extensions contribute to the competition score, analyze why they help. If not, try to explain why it was not useful.##Individual Member ContributionBriefly explain the contribution of an individual group member. You could report if working loads are unfairly distributed.
